# Doc-Generator
A python based GUI, it takes an excel file as input and a .docx template as the output reference to generate a single/multiple document for each row in the excel file.

Certains fields inside the template can be manipulated to reflect individual data for each doc like first name, last name, date, department etc.

The GUio was build for a specific business case and may not apply to all case. But you are welcome to use the structure to meet your requirement.
